### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    In Lab 5, we were introduced to the concept of calculating the arithmetic mean, which is also known as the average, of a given expression. This is an important mathematical concept that is used in many different fields, such as statistics and data analysis. To perform this calculation, we used a programming construct called a double, which is a data type that is used to store decimal values, or floats. Using doubles allowed us to create equations that were more accurate, because they could represent a wider range of decimal values than other data types.

* Lab 7
    Lab 7 was a particularly interesting lab, because we learned how to use a scoreboard and booleans. A scoreboard is a tool that is used to keep track of the scores of multiple players in a game. In this case, we used a scoreboard to keep track of the scores of different players in a game of Blackjack. We also learned about booleans, which are a data type that can only have two possible values: true or false. Booleans are commonly used in programming to represent the outcome of a logical test, such as checking whether a number is greater than or less than another number. In this lab, we learned how to use booleans to create functions that could be used in our Blackjack game.

* Lab 10
    In Lab 10, we focused on using arrays, which are data structures that are used to store collections of values. We learned how to create a simple 2D array, which is an array that has two dimensions, or axes. This type of array is useful for storing and organizing data that has multiple components, such as the coordinates of a point on a graph. In this lab, we used a 2D array to store the scores of different players in a game. We also learned how to use a non-zero return value to create a void function, which is a type of function that does not return a value. This is an advanced concept that is useful for creating functions that perform a specific task, such as printing the scores of a game to the screen. Overall, this lab helped us to understand how to use arrays and void functions in our programs.
